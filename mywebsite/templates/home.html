    <p>
        I am a motivated and ambitious self-taught Python developer. As a Computer Science student I've learnt and gained experience with Python and Java at a tertiary level. I am currently employed as an IT Technical Coordinator but I am also being mentored in Python development at my current place of employment by the Senior Developer. I have completed a number of development projects and contributed to the company's day-to-day processes with my code. My main aim is to be completely focused on development.
